# Google Summer of Code 2025: NiiVue Cloud Deployment and Fullstack Development

## 1) Project Information

**Project Title:** Cloud Deployment Framework for NiiVue: A Fullstack Solution for Neuroimaging Applications

**Project Summary:** 
This project aims to enhance NiiVue's ecosystem by developing a comprehensive cloud deployment framework and fullstack solution for neuroimaging applications. I will create a standardized, well-documented demonstration project that bridges NiiVue's powerful frontend visualization capabilities with backend neuroimaging processing pipelines. The project focuses on three key deliverables:

1. **Robust Cloud Deployment Framework**: Extending the Fullstack NiiVue repository with Docker/Kubernetes configurations and deployment workflows for AWS, GCP, and Azure, enabling one-click deployment of NiiVue-based applications.

2. **Modular Backend Integration System**: Implementing a flexible backend framework that seamlessly connects NiiVue's frontend with neuroimaging tools (AFNI, FSL, FreeSurfer) through a standardized API layer, allowing researchers to easily implement custom processing pipelines.

3. **Comprehensive Documentation & Example Applications**: Creating detailed guides, tutorials, and reference implementations that demonstrate real-world neuroimaging workflows, empowering developers to rapidly build and deploy their own NiiVue-based solutions.

By project completion, NiiVue will have a robust reference implementation for cloud-based neuroimaging workflows, empowering researchers and developers to build sophisticated, scalable applications leveraging NiiVue's visualization capabilities.

## 10) More About Me

I am deeply passionate about the intersection of neuroscience and software engineering. My journey into neuroimaging began during a research internship where I witnessed firsthand how limited access to computational resources hampered scientific progress. Many researchers with brilliant ideas were unable to implement them due to technical barriers in deploying and scaling their analysis pipelines.

This experience drove me to focus on making scientific computing more accessible through modern web technologies and cloud deployment solutions. The NiiVue project represents an ideal opportunity to combine my technical skills with my passion for advancing neuroimaging research.

What sets me apart is my holistic approach to software development. I believe that truly impactful tools must not only be technically sound but also:

1. **Accessible to users with varying technical backgrounds**
2. **Deployable across different environments with minimal friction**
3. **Well-documented to enable adoption and extension by the community**
4. **Maintainable over time with clear architecture and testing**

I've demonstrated these principles in my previous projects. For instance, my GNOME Shell extension was designed to be usable by non-technical users while still offering advanced customization for power users. Similarly, my work on Speed Share focused on creating a simple interface for a technically complex WebRTC implementation.

Beyond my technical contributions, I'm an active advocate for open science and have organized three workshops at my university to introduce students to open source scientific software development. I believe that democratizing access to advanced computational tools is essential for accelerating scientific discovery.

The cloud deployment framework I propose for NiiVue aligns perfectly with this mission. By creating a standardized, well-documented approach to deploying neuroimaging applications in the cloud, we can significantly lower the barrier to entry for researchers worldwide, regardless of their institutional resources or technical background.

I am excited about the potential impact of this project and am committed to creating a solution that will benefit the broader neuroimaging community for years to come.
