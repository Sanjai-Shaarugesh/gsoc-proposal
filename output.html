<h1>Google Summer of Code 2025: OneBusAway Wayfinder</h1>

<h2>1) Project Information</h2>

<p><strong>Project Title:</strong> Wayfinder Improvements: Accessibility, Testing, and UI Enhancements</p>

<p><strong>Project Summary:</strong>
This project aims to transform the OneBusAway Wayfinder application, a SvelteKit-based web application for transit information and navigation. With a three-pronged approach, I will: (1) conduct a comprehensive accessibility audit using both automated and manual testing to implement WCAG 2.1 AA compliance, (2) develop a robust testing infrastructure with unit, integration, and E2E tests to ensure code quality and prevent regressions, and (3) implement critical UI/UX refinements based on user feedback and modern design principles. These improvements will make Wayfinder more usable for all transit users, particularly those with disabilities, while strengthening the codebase for future development. By project completion, Wayfinder will be significantly more accessible, maintainable, and user-friendly.</p>

<h2>9) More About Me</h2>

<p>I'm deeply passionate about improving the accessibility of public transit information systems because I believe that technology should empower everyone, regardless of ability. Growing up in Tamil Nadu, I've experienced firsthand how difficult public transportation can be to navigate, especially for people with disabilities. This motivates me to contribute to projects like OneBusAway that democratize access to essential services.</p>

<p>What excites me most about this project is the opportunity to make a tangible impact on real users' lives. By improving Wayfinder's accessibility, testing, and user experience, we can help people navigate their cities more easily and confidently. My background in web development, coupled with my experience in accessibility testing and UI design, makes this project a perfect fit for my skills and interests.</p>

<p>Beyond technical skills, I bring a user-centered perspective and a meticulous attention to detail. I'm committed to creating software that's not just functional but also intuitive and accessible to everyone. The OneBusAway project's mission of improving public transit through open data and open source software deeply resonates with me, and I would be honored to contribute to this important work.</p>

<p>I look forward to the opportunity to collaborate with the OneBusAway community and contribute to making Wayfinder even better for all users.</p>
